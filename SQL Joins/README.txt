üåü Exploring Advanced SQLJoins: A Mobile Product and Specification Case Study! üåü
‚ú® Project Overview
In this project, I demonstrate how different types of SQL joins‚Äîsuch as INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and UNION ALL‚Äîcan be used to merge datasets and extract meaningful insights. The focus is on linking mobile product data with their specifications to analyze relationships between them.

Database Structure

-- Create 'product' table
CREATE TABLE product (
    product_id INT,
    product_name CHAR(40),
    price FLOAT,
    brand VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Create 'spacifications' table
CREATE TABLE spacifications (
    ID INT,
    RAM VARCHAR(20),
    ROM VARCHAR(20)
);

product Table:
Contains details about mobile products, including product_id, product_name, price, and brand.
spacifications Table:
Stores the RAM and ROM configurations associated with each mobile, linked by product_id.
Objectives
Merge datasets using SQL joins.
Analyze relationships between mobile products and their specifications.
Understand and apply different join types in SQL for data integration and analysis.

üîç Key SQL Queries

1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN

Combines rows from both tables where there‚Äôs a matching product_id, ensuring only products with specifications are returned.

Result: Returns records where there is a match in both tables on product_id.

2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

Includes all records from the product table, even if there are no matching specifications in the spacifications table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN

Includes all records from the spacifications table, even if there are no matching products in the product table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

4Ô∏è‚É£ UNION ALL with LEFT and RIGHT JOINS

Returns all records from both tables, ensuring all possible matches and non-matches are included.

üìä Insights Gained

Data Integration: Combining datasets to produce comprehensive insights.
Flexible Analysis: Different join types allow for a deeper understanding of the data relationships.
Practical Applications: Hands-on experience with real-world datasets and SQL join operations.
