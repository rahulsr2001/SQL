üåü Exploring Advanced SQLJoins: A Mobile Product and Specification Case Study! üåü
‚ú® Project Overview
In this project, I demonstrate how different types of SQL joins‚Äîsuch as INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and UNION ALL‚Äîcan be used to merge datasets and extract meaningful insights. The focus is on linking mobile product data with their specifications to analyze relationships between them.

Database Structure

-- Create 'product' table
CREATE TABLE product (
    product_id INT,
    product_name CHAR(40),
    price FLOAT,
    brand VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Create 'spacifications' table
CREATE TABLE spacifications (
    ID INT,
    RAM VARCHAR(20),
    ROM VARCHAR(20)
);

product Table:
Contains details about mobile products, including product_id, product_name, price, and brand.
spacifications Table:
Stores the RAM and ROM configurations associated with each mobile, linked by product_id.
Objectives
Merge datasets using SQL joins.
Analyze relationships between mobile products and their specifications.
Understand and apply different join types in SQL for data integration and analysis.

üîç Key SQL Queries

1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN

The query demonstrates how to retrieve matching records from both product and spacifications tables.

-Combines rows from both tables where there‚Äôs a matching product_id, ensuring only products with specifications are returned.

2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

The query retrieves all records from the product table, including unmatched rows, and matching rows from spacifications.

-Includes all records from the product table, even if there are no matching specifications in the spacifications table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN

The query retrieves all records from the spacifications table, including unmatched rows, and matching rows from product.

-Includes all records from the spacifications table, even if there are no matching products in the product table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

4Ô∏è‚É£ UNION ALL with LEFT and RIGHT JOINS

This query combines the results from both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to get a complete view of all matched and unmatched records from both tables.

-Returns all records from both tables, ensuring all possible matches and non-matches are included.
