🌟 Exploring Advanced SQLJoins: A Mobile Product and Specification Case Study! 🌟
✨ Project Overview
In this project, I demonstrate how different types of SQL joins—such as INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and UNION ALL—can be used to merge datasets and extract meaningful insights. The focus is on linking mobile product data with their specifications to analyze relationships between them.

Database Structure

-- Create 'product' table
CREATE TABLE product (
    product_id INT,
    product_name CHAR(40),
    price FLOAT,
    brand VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Create 'spacifications' table
CREATE TABLE spacifications (
    ID INT,
    RAM VARCHAR(20),
    ROM VARCHAR(20)
);

product Table:
Contains details about mobile products, including product_id, product_name, price, and brand.
spacifications Table:
Stores the RAM and ROM configurations associated with each mobile, linked by product_id.
Objectives
Merge datasets using SQL joins.
Analyze relationships between mobile products and their specifications.
Understand and apply different join types in SQL for data integration and analysis.

🔍 Key SQL Queries

1️⃣ INNER JOIN

Combines rows from both tables where there’s a matching product_id, ensuring only products with specifications are returned.

Result: Returns records where there is a match in both tables on product_id.

2️⃣ LEFT JOIN

Includes all records from the product table, even if there are no matching specifications in the spacifications table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN

Includes all records from the spacifications table, even if there are no matching products in the product table, displaying unmatched rows as NULL.

4️⃣ UNION ALL with LEFT and RIGHT JOINS

Returns all records from both tables, ensuring all possible matches and non-matches are included.

📊 Insights Gained
